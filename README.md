# Please someone help me make a camera scanner for it? now tbh im not a good programmer so i cant do it myself
# tipuqr
a replacement to the popular qr codes that can store way more data

# How to use
you simply download the code and in that folder python file2tipu.py file.exe # it can be any file extension
then when you want the file from the qr code png file you run  python tipu2file.py exe # that is the file extension you want for the recovered file



# i think that sometime im gonna rewrite this in c or c++ not promising anything
